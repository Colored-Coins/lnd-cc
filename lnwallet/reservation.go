// ChannelReservation represents an intent to open a lightning payment channel
// a counterpaty. The funding proceses from reservation to channel opening is a
// 3-step process. In order to allow for full concurrency during the reservation
// workflow, resources consumed by a contribution are "locked" themselves. This
// prevents a number of race conditions such as two funding transactions
// double-spending the same input. A reservation can also be cancelled, which
// removes the resources from limbo, allowing another reservation to claim them.
//
// The reservation workflow consists of the following three steps:
//  1. lnwallet.InitChannelReservation
//     * One requests the wallet to allocate the neccessary resources for a
//      channel reservation. These resources a put in limbo for the lifetime
//      of a reservation.
//    * Once completed the reservation will have the wallet's contribution
//      accessible via the .OurContribution() method. This contribution
//      contains the neccessary items to allow the remote party to build both
//      the funding, and commitment transactions.
//  2. ChannelReservation.ProcessContribution/ChannelReservation.ProcessSingleContribution
//     * The counterparty presents their contribution to the payment channel.
//       This allows us to build the funding, and commitment transactions
//       ourselves.
//     * We're now able to sign our inputs to the funding transactions, and
//       the counterparty's version of the commitment transaction.
//     * All signatures crafted by us, are now available via .OurSignatures().
//  3. ChannelReservation.CompleteReservation/ChannelReservation.CompleteReservationSingle
//     * The final step in the workflow. The counterparty presents the
//       signatures for all their inputs to the funding transation, as well
//       as a signature to our version of the commitment transaction.
//     * We then verify the validity of all signatures before considering the
//       channel "open".
